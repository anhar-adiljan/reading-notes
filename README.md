# README

This repository is for recording and sharing reading notes for technical
contents, including blog posts, tutorials, books, video clips, podcast
episodes etc.

Ideally, these notes should be submitted as Markdown documents or Jupyter
notebook files.

Links to original contents should be attached at the top of each file
submitted to this repository.

## Idea for Future Usage

* Translation of technical contents into other languages.
